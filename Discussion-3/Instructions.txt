Is array sorted?

With your programming partner, write a program that reads a list of integers from input into an array and outputs "yes" if the list is sorted in ascending order between two provided positions. Otherwise, output "no". The first input specifies the number of items in the list. The next set of inputs is the list. The last two inputs are the start and end positions (inclusive). Assume the list contains less than 20 integers and position 1 is the first element. (If the user enters 1 3 for the 2 provided positions, you should use 0 and 2).

Ex: If the input is:

8 
5 6 7 4 3 2 1 0
1 3


the output is:

yes


Ex: If the input is:

6 
1 2 3 4 5 2
4 6


the output is:

no

Debugging
 Tutorial

With your programming partner, you will design and write a program that has a bug. Find the bug and explain how to avoid such bugs and fix the bug.

Your program could use any coding construct like conditional, loops, arrays, structs or pointers. The bug that you introduce must not be syntactical - meaning, missing semi colons, curly brackets, misspelling variables, etc are not bugs. They are syntax errors. Errors that are logical - meaning your program compiles, but you have errors when the program runs. Do not explain the bug - let your peers find the bug and try to offer solutions to fix your bug.

For example:&nbsp;

Syntax error:

cout << "This is not right!!";

A bug:

if (number > 0);
{
   cout << "Find the bug!!";
}

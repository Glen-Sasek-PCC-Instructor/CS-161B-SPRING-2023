9.8 LAB: Swapping variables
Write a program whose input is two integers and whose output is the two integers swapped.

Ex: If the input is:

3 8
the output is:

8 3
Your program must define and call a function. SwapValues swaps the two values such that if userVal1 = 3 and userVal2 = 8, after the function is called userVal1 = 8, and userVal2 = 3.

void SwapValues(int &userVal1, int &userVal2)
